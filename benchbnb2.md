# BenchBnB: Part 2

**You must finish BenchBnB Phases 1-6 before proceeding to BenchBnB Part 2. If
you have not yet finished the earlier Phases, return to the point where you
stopped and continue working from there.**

[Live Demo]

Part 2 of BenchBnB comprises Phases 7-10. In this part, you will finally create
your map (Phase 7), add features like filters (Phase 8) and photos (Phase 9),
and then polish your app with little touches to enhance the user experience
(Phase 10).
